### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
    - Microsoft Windows XP (original operating system)
    - WinIsis (database original cataloger)
	- VirtualBox (software to virtualize operating system inside other operating systems)
	- [Beautiful Soap](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download): unencoding of unicode text to UTF-8 format specification. A kind of swiss-army knife of encoding-unencoding text files. 
	- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): deploy apps inside virtual environments. A time-saver in the process of cut and paste in-from a myriad of applications between different operating systems.
* Configuration

* Dependencies
     - In terms of workflow, there is a previous repository: [Terrae database](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/terrae-database)
