### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
    - Microsoft Windows XP (operating system)
    - [WinIsis](http://wiki.bireme.org/es/index.php/CDS-ISIS_for_Windows) (bibliographic database cataloger)
	- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (software to virtualize one operating system inside another operating systems)
	- [Beautiful Soap](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download): unencoding of unicode text to UTF-8 format specification. A kind of swiss-army knife of encoding-unencoding text files. 
	- [Text Compare!](https://text-compare.com/) (online diff tool that allows you to easily make a text comparison and find the differences between two texts)
	- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): deploy apps inside virtual environments. A time-saver in the process of cut and paste in-from a myriad of applications between different operating systems.
* Configuration
